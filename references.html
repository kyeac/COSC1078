      <p>Hi, my name is Kye Cisternas and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. My father is originally from Chile in South America and moved here when he was 10 years old to start a new life with his parents and siblings. My mother was also born in Australia with mostly Scottish ancestry. I'm currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT however this is not my first degree at this institution. After graduating high school I pursued an Advanced Diploma of Building Design (Architectural) as I had a keen interest in Architecture and the built environment. I successfully completed this two and a half year course, however I began to realise that the work and industry was not what I was expecting. I decided to abandon that pathway and shift my focus to the world of Information Technology. </p>
