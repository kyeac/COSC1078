      <h2>Personal Information</h2>

      <p>Hi, my name is Kye Cisternas and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. My father is originally from Chile in South America and moved here when he was 10 years old to start a new life with his parents and siblings. My mother was also born in Australia with mostly Scottish ancestry. I'm currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT however this is not my first degree at this institution. After graduating high school, I pursued an Advanced Diploma of Building Design (Architectural) as I had a keen interest in Architecture and the built environment. I successfully completed this two and a half year course, however I began to realise that the work and industry was not what I was expecting. I decided to abandon that pathway and shift my focus to the world of Information Technology.

      </div>
      <p>I never played much sport growing up, however, I've always been a fan of both American Grid Iron, Australian Rules football and soccer. I was fortunate enough to tick an item off my bucket list and attend the Superbowl 51 in Atlanta, United States. As an avid world traveller, I have been able to see some incredible things. From riding a camel and attending a traditional Bedouin campsite in Dubai, to witnessing the active volcano Kilauea erupting in Hawaii. My most memorable moment however would have to be visiting the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, USA. I am always in awe at the scale and vastness of outer space so getting to see and touch a rock from the moon and the space shuttles was such an unforgettable experience. I have also recently found a new albeit expensive hobby in collecting limited sneakers. </p>


      <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
      <p>Information Technology has always amazed me with it's endless possibilities. There are so many different pathways one can choose to venture down and I believe they all significantly improve our lives. Whether that be in the medical industry, entertainment, security, or design, Information Technology has proved to us all that we simply cannot live without it. </p>

      <p>My interest in IT began at an early age. I remember always being excited when my dad allowed me to use his computer to play games or browse the internet via dial-up, or even watching my favourite childhood shows on a VCR video tape. Simply being able to watch the transitions from VCR to DVD to now being able to instantaneously stream makes me wonder what else the world of IT has in store for us. Something as simple as looking at Wikipedia pages was so fascinating for me. With the dawn of websites such as YouTube, I was able to watch endless videos of tech unboxings and learn about the different specifications and hardware that would go into everyday products such as laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras. Marques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, was and still is a great source of inspiration for my interest in IT thanks to his simple yet informative YouTube channel which focuses on reviewing the latest tech and gadgets releasing around the world.</p>

      <p>Having already studied at RMIT University made it an easy choice for me to choose this institution once again. Living in the western suburbs of Melbourne does not leave me with too many choices for universities that are easy to access by public transport, however RMIT meets my needs. The location is prime in the Melbourne Central Business District and within reach of many students, making it an easy commute for everyone I have spoken to. I am very familiar with the facilities and location of amenities that this university provides. RMIT is also one of Australia's top performing universities and "Ranked in the top 100 globally for Computer Science and Information Systems programs" from Best Global World University Rankings (2021).
      </p>

      <p>In this degree, I expect to learn the basic concepts of Information Technology as well as a variety of IT and general elective courses. In particular I would love to learn some more advanced programming and security in Information Technology. I expect to graduate and be able to use the knowledge gained throughout this course to start and pursue a promising career in the IT industry.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <a href="jobad.pdf"target="_blank">Offensive Security Consultant (Penetration Testing)</a>

      <p>This job with Loop Offensive Security Services (OSS) is for experienced penetration testers who can bring their technical expertise, consulting, and leadership skills to their team. Pen testing or penetration testing involves the digital and/or physical attack on a computer system to check for vulnerabilities or exploits. This job would involve working independently and in a team to perform various methods of penetration testing. Physical Intrusion testing is one particular aspect of this job that appeals to me. The ability to try and test for vulnerabilities in a company's security system on-site would make for a thrilling and challenging task. Other tasks associated with this role would include; testing of web apps, mobile apps, internal and external infrastructure, simulated phishing campaigns, and adversary simulation or red teaming.</p>

      <p> The ideal candidate does not require a postgraduate qualification in Information Technology, however it is expected that candidates have practical training in at least one penetration testing discipline as well as at least one security certificate. Examples may include GPEN, GWAPT, GMOB, GXPN, GCPN, OSCP, OSWE, OSEP, OSEE, CREST, CISSP. Security professionals looking to apply must have relevant experience of 1-5 years experience working independently on penetration testing, 1-5 years working experience with internal/external penetration testing methodology,  1-5 years working experience with web application or mobile application penetration testing methodology, experience effectively delivering small to medium engagements. Knowledge and effective use of Windows Active Directory attack techniques, cloud platform attack techniques, Linux attack techniques, and web/mobile application attack techniques are also all mandatory prerequisites for this job. Candidates should be persistent and open to learning, work well independently as well as in a team, detail and achievement oriented, have excellent written and verbal communication and strong interpersonal skills.
      </p>

      <p>I'm an RMIT graduate who is currently working for Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV) as a Resident Support Officer. My current position with the Victorian State Government as a Resident Support Officer has given me the skills to work in a highly stressful environment. I follow and adhere to strict infection prevention and control protocols and am able to adapt quickly and change when presented with a challenge. I provide a great sense of care, compassion and customer service for the residents that I supervise in the Victorian Hotel Quarantine program. I am a team player with excellent problem solving and communication skills. Prior to my current position, I worked as a data entry operator for an administration company, where I handled confidential information in a range of projects with a high level of tact and discretion. Accuracy and attention to detail when inputting data is one of my highest priorities. I graduated from RMIT University in 2018 with an Advanced Diploma of Building Design.
      </p>

      <p>I plan to graduate from RMIT University again with a Bachelor of Information Technology, which would be considered more appropriate and desirable for this position than my current diploma. This course will greatly enhance my knowledge in information security and give me some technical experience in relevant areas. After completion of this course, I intend to find a graduate job with an information security company. Once I have satisfied the required years of experience, I would need to obtain an IT security certificate such as CISSP or GPEN. With the 1-5 years of experience working in a security based role and my relevant security certification, I would then be able to apply for the position of Offensive Security Consultant. I believe I already satisfy most of the required skills which I have gathered from my prior work experience and education, in particular my ability to work well independently and in a team, and my persistence to learn and problem solve in various environments.

      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <img src="consul_indepth.jpg" alt="Consul personality traits" style="width:100%">
      </div>

      <h3>Myers Briggs Personality Test</h3>
      <p>Based on my Myers-Briggs personality test, I am a Consul ESFJ-T. This means I can be categorised in one of two options for 5 different categories, those being Extroverted, Observant, Feeling, Judging and Turbulent. It is a very common personality type with 12% of the global population categorizing themselves as Consuls.</p>

      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>Consuls can be described as the pillars of the groups in which they belong to and tend to always be relied upon as they are very loyal. They make for extremely trustworthy employees and partners and value stability and security very highly. Being sociable, comfortable and well-liked is necessary for a Consul. They are very open to talk to and naturally play an active role in their communities. Due to having a strong sense of duty, consuls are determined to meet their goals and obligations, although this may stem from their desire to keep their social reputation. Consuls have strong practical skills, ensuring that those around them are taken care of and are outstanding at managing their routines and everyday tasks. Caring deeply and maintaining peace with others, Consuls are always there to put others happiness first. They take pride in being selfless but also ensuring that the team gets the job done.</p>

      <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
      <p>Consuls can become very defensive when questioned on their choices, especially if it is someone close to them. They find it challenging to be put on the spot as they avoid conflict and are vulnerable to criticism. Stemming from one of their greatest strengths, Consuls may also find that worrying too much about their social status can be a hinderance. This can affect the decisions they make and limit their potential for creativity. It can be daunting for them to step outside their comfort zones due to fears of rejection or appearing as different. Consuls love to feel appreciated, so if their efforts towards others are not being noticed they tend to feel disheartened. Another strength turned weakness is that Consuls are too selfless and empathetic. They can often forget about themselves in their quest to please all those around them.</p>

      <p>I believe that the results of my Myers-Briggs test are a fairly accurate representation of my personality. It is interesting to see that I could fall into either category for many of my results, with my 'Extraverted' mind trait being especially close at 52%. Personally, I do believe I am more 'Introverted' rather than 'Extroverted' as I tend to keep to myself more often than not. My most dominant trait is my nature of 'Feeling' at 64%, which in my opinion is still quite close to being the inverse trait of 'Thinking'. As a 'Sentinel' I do tend to be self-motivated and follow a more technical rather than creative approach in projects. </p>

      <p>As a Consul, I believe I thrive when working in teams. I am very determined to meet the goals of a business and care deeply about my team members and their needs. As discussed in the strengths section, Consuls make for extremely trustworthy employees and are very social. This loyal trait I believe is extremely invaluable and something I take great pride in. My goal when working in a team is always to get the job done efficiently and effectively as possible.
      </p>

      <p>I can be relied on when forming a team as communication is one of my strongest skills and being able to stay on top of the task at hand and manage routines efficiently and effectively is vital for me. I am happy to talk openly with everyone and do have very strong practical skills. I'm not afraid to take the lead in a group setting, however I am quite vulnerable to criticism which can let me down at times.</p>

      <h3>LifeTrain Learning Style Quiz</h3>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <div class= centredimage>
          <img src="learningstyles.png" alt="Learning style quiz results" style="width:50%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The results of the test above are taken from LifeTrain's learning style quiz. This quiz is used to determine how we approach things and the different ways in which we all learn. The pie chart gets segmented into 4 parts that depict the learning styles of Reflector, Theorist, Pragmatist and Activist. The percentages are determined by the simple yes or no answer to 24 quiz statements. As you can see, my Theorist and Pragmatist learning styles dominate most of the chart with the two results accounting for a combined 62%. As a pragmatist learner, I tend to be more technical and therefore abstract thinking is one of my weak attributes. I tend to think rationally and choose to learn more based on common theories and principals. I feel as though pragmatist and theorist learning styles go hand in hand in this regard and accurately represent my preferred way of learning.</p>

      <p>Given my fairly equal split of learning styles, I believe my behaviour when working in a team would be advantageous. I may tend to take a back seat at times to observe what is going on, but once I do begin to understand I am able to work in an effective manner. With my reflector learning style, I can use the information gathered from previous experiences and observe other methods of learning to help me function in groups. My downfall may be my inability to be as open-minded as others when trying to learn something new as I prefer to focus on a more practical and theoretical approach to my work.</p>

      <p>I encourage discussions with those I work with, thus making it very easy to form a team or be an active member in one. I prefer to put ideas into practice as soon as possible rather than dwell on abstract thinking or reasoning which makes for an efficient workflow. I very much believe in tutorials as a way to engage a group and encourage input from every team member to get the most out of our efforts. Having a strict and disciplined theorist learning style has allowed me to focus on rationality and keeping on top of the task at hand, which is vital for a team that needs to meet their goals.</p>


      <h3>IPIP Big Five Factor Markers</h3>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <div class= centredimage>
          <img src="big5test.png" alt="Big 5 Factor Markers results" style="width:65%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>These are the results of my IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test. In this test I was given a raw score alongside a score percentile to determine the strength or weakness of my personality traits in five big factors. They are a commonly used model of ones personality and used frequently in psychology studies. The traits include Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Intellect/Imagination. Once again this test highlights the difference between extroverts and introverts and categorizes me more appropriately as slightly more introverted when compared to my previous Myers-Briggs personality test. As can be seen in my results I scored in the 41st percentile for Extroversion, placing me as a slightly more introverted person however I do still enjoy socializing and do not enjoy being isolated in my personal life. Having a high score in the third factor, Agreeableness is typical of me as a friendly and optimistic person.</p>

      <p>I am a welcome addition to a team environment due to having such a high score in the fourth factor, Conscientiousness. This is reflected in the fact that I am diligent and take pride in my work and do not make irrational decisions that may negatively impact the team. I do not have a neurotic personality, therefore I would not be shy or irritable when communication is key.</p>

      <p>When forming a team I am very approachable and friendly to be around. I may not be the loudest person in the group due to being slightly more introverted, however my presence is still known and I am always open to listening. I may struggle a bit with my creativity and imagination, however I make up for this with my ability to be more technical and conventional in my approaches to work in general and in group settings.</p>



      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>A smartphone application that can be used to authenticate and verify original sneakers. The app will prompt users to take images and/or videos of their chosen sneakers to be scanned and checked for any flaws or discrepancies that may lead to the chosen sneaker failing a legitimate check. If the sneaker passes all checks, the user can rest assured that they have an authentic pair of sneakers. The sneaker check and authentication system will work by employing a range of techniques, both automatic and manual, to disqualify replica sneakers.
      </p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>The sneaker resale market is a huge and widely popular place for people to buy, sell and trade their coveted sneakers. Many people run businesses solely to turn a profit by purchasing sneakers for their retail price (RRP) and selling them, still brand new and unworn at a premium. The sneaker market as a whole was valued at $79 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to rise to $120 billion USD by 2026 as stated by Braithwaite (2021). According to a 2020 Cowan Research Equity study, the sneaker resell market accounts for $2 billion USD of the entire global sneaker market and could explode up to $30 billion USD by 2030.  Popular athletic brands and designers team up to provide consumers with a massive selection of rare and collectible sneakers that sell for a higher price. Familiar companies such as Nike, Adidas and even New Balance produce limited and hard to obtain sneakers which fuel the secondary reselling market. </p>

      <p>With the insane demand and incredibly profitable business model that comes with sneaker reselling, so do replicas and unauthorized copies of popular brands. Counterfeit items have become increasingly harder to detect as manufacturers have perfected their craft, to the point where most people cannot tell the difference between a genuine product and a replica. Many popular sites such as StockX, act as a middleman in the sneaker reselling market. StockX is a global marketplace used to sell collectibles and fashion products. To sell through their website you must go through a strict process. You send a shoe that you wish to sell to them, they will authenticate that it is genuine, without flaws, new and unworn and with all its original tags, and then they will ship that sneaker to the buyer. This can become quite a tedious process and purchasing through websites like this can leave consumers waiting up to two months to receive the items they have purchased. This sneaker authentication application can alleviate some of the pressure and remove one of the extra steps that sites such as StockX must go through to verify original products. It also gives the average consumer the ability to check that the shoes that they have purchased for their own collection are indeed genuine.</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The app is intended to be able to detect flaws and imperfections by comparing against inhouse databases that include a growing collection of original and authentic sneakers. To begin, users will open the app and be shown a prompt to upload a series of photographs and/or videos. They will be guided through a step-by-step process on the correct way to upload the requested media and ensure they include: every side of the sneaker, the interior tag of the shoe, the original box inclusive of any labels describing the shoe and any other model specific criteria. Once the correct media has been provided, the users will be informed on whether the upload is satisfactory. Satisfactory uploads will then be compared digitally against the growing database of authentic sneakers to check for discrepancies between the uploaded images and brand new originals. Unsatisfactory uploads will however go back to the beginning and start the process of sneaker authentication over again. They will be reminded of the criteria that needs to be met. A combination of digital recognition software and manual checking of the uploaded media will be employed to determine a sneaker's authenticity. The majority of all checks will be automated using this recognition technology however the hard to determine cases may need escalation and to be checked over by an employee or trained professional.
      </p>

      <p>The app intends to be the market leader in sneaker verification technology by employing the unique digital recognition software as the primary method. The ability to employ this method of authentication would make it one of a kind. A competitor sneaker verification application claims to use AI to detect any inconsistencies, however this particular app suffers from very negative feedback. Their reviews on Apple's AppStore and Android's Google Play Store depict a picture of an app that is failing to meet the expectations of their customers. Customer reviews claim that many of their requests fail for no apparent reason and that the app does not seem to work as intended. They also claim that a trusted professional looks over each shoe, which can be a rather slow process at times compared to our method of using digital recognition first. Other competitor applications use trusted professionals to authenticate every sneaker, however they fail to use any automatic digital recognition software.  The last competitor application only uses a simple selection of images for each particular sneaker and leaves it up to the user to determine whether their sneakers are genuine or not. This presents many issues for users and sellers as there is no third party or trusted way in which their shoes can be considered authentic or not.
      </p>

      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>Using proto.io to create a basic prototype of how the app would look and feel is the first step in allowing this app to come to life. A basic prototype showing all the features is a great way to visualize how the app would look and function for its end users. After the initial prototype stage, the app would need to be developed for iOS and Android. The next stage would be building a database with SQL of the authentic sneaker collection using a massive selection of photos. As mentioned this database will grow with the app and continue to grow until an adequate selection of images are available for comparison. App development would then begin to take place. </p>

      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>The app will be built using the Python programming language as this allows for easier machine learning for the digital comparison of sneakers. An experienced app development team who have experience with machine learning or artificial intelligence would need to be employed to make this a reality. Countless testing would need to be undertaken as well to test the reliability of the software and the accuracy of the digital sneaker authentication system. Once this system is stable enough and can correctly detect counterfeit sneakers instantaneously, the app would be ready to be published on both iOS and Android platforms. It may take time for the database to be filled with enough accurate images of genuine sneakers which may delay the initial rollout of the application.</p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>Upon successful rollout of this application, users will be able to check the legitimacy and authenticity of their beloved sneakers with ease. From casual users to small business owners, this app would revolutionize the way in which sneakers are authenticated. It solves the problem of middleman markets needing to physical check each shoe one by one, thus speeding up the process when buying and selling a sneaker. Collectors and sellers alike would have peace of mind that their products are truly genuine and can make successful trades much more easily.</p>
